## Obesity Prevalence Exercise

This application utilizes data provided by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) of the University of Washington on global obesity prevalence. 

Using React and D3, it provides the user an scatter chart documenting obesity prevalence in the United States by year. The user has the capability to change the year, so that they may gather information on all years provided by the CSV document's data. By hovering over the chart's points, the user may learn more information about that point of data, including the prevalence percentage, age group, sex, and the metric.
